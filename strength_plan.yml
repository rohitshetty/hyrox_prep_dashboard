# Strength Training Plan for Hyrox
# Full 5-Day PPL integrated with running schedule
# Based on PPL hypertrophy methodology from context

meta:
  goal: Build strength + muscle for Hyrox and body recomposition
  frequency: 5 strength sessions/week integrated with 4 runs
  duration: 40-60 min (longer on Saturday)
  cycleLength: 4 weeks
  philosophy: |
    Full PPL split integrated with Hyrox running. Each strength day is paired
    strategically with running to optimize recovery. Thursday stays light per
    your preference. Saturday allows longer combined sessions. This supports
