# Hyrox Station Training Plan
# Integrated with run_plan.yml and strength_plan.yml
# 12-Week Program for Sub-70 Minute Finish

meta:
  goal: Prepare for sub-70 minute Hyrox finish
  raceDate: April 12, 2026
  targetTime: "< 70 minutes"
  philosophy: |
    Hyrox success comes from efficient transitions and sustainable pacing across
    8 running segments and 8 functional stations. Running accounts for ~50% of
    race time - your run_plan.yml is the foundation. This plan builds the other 50%.

    Key principles:
    - Train heavier than race weight so competition feels manageable
    - Practice "compromised running" - running under fatigue after stations
    - Master transitions - seconds lost add up across 16 transitions
    - Build mental resilience to push through accumulated fatigue
    - Simulate race conditions progressively leading to full simulations

# Hyrox Training Structure
hyroxTrainingDays:
  tuesday:
    name: Hyrox Endurance Day
    duration: 50-75 min
    focus: |
      Your PRIMARY Hyrox training day. This is when you build race-specific fitness:
      - "Compromised running" - running under fatigue after stations
      - Station combinations mimicking race sequences
      - Progressive race simulations (half → full)
      - Mental resilience training through fatigue accumulation

      No running or lifting scheduled today - dedicate full energy to Hyrox.

  thursday:
    name: Light Hyrox Practice
    duration: 15-20 min (part of strength session)
    focus: |
      Technique refinement and light movement practice. Included in
      strength_plan.yml Thursday sessions. Keep intensity LOW - this is
      the day before Friday intervals.

  saturday:
    name: Optional Station Practice
    duration: 15-30 min (after deadlifts, if energy permits)
    focus: |
      Light station work after your deadlift session. Focus on movements
      that complement your strength work. Keep it brief - you've already
      done long run + deadlifts. This is optional recovery-intensity work.
